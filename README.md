# Lets-create-together

Good day, I'm @VladCaye.
I'm interested in website and app development. Nowadays the #NFT craze is occupying quite some space in my thoughts too :)<br><br>
I'm currently trying to figure which framework/resource should I be using to start playing with 2D, 3D and game engines like Unity or Unreal. Make sense?
I'm also looking to collaborate with any other developers to gain experience and to share my knowlege with the community.<br><br>
